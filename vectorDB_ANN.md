# Study Notes: Deep Dive into Vector Databases

## 1. Introduction to Vector Databases

A **vector database** is a type of database designed specifically for managing, indexing, and querying vector embeddings. These vectors are often produced by machine learning models and represent the features of complex data such as text, images, or audio. The primary advantage of using vector databases lies in their ability to perform **similarity searches**, which are essential for AI-driven applications like recommendation systems, semantic search, and clustering.

## 2. Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Vector Embeddings** | - Numerical representations (often high-dimensional arrays) of data points<br>- Generated by machine learning models to capture semantic or latent features |
| **Similarity Metrics** | - **Cosine Similarity**: Measures angle between vectors<br>- **Euclidean Distance**: Measures straight-line distance in multi-dimensional space<br>- **Inner Product**: Useful for understanding similarity of vectors with large magnitudes |
| **Approximate Nearest Neighbors (ANN)** | - Used to approximate nearest neighbors<br>- Provides faster and scalable searches, especially in high-dimensional spaces |

---

## 3. Use Cases for Vector Databases

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Recommendation Systems** | Store item embeddings (e.g., products or videos), and find similar items to recommend based on a user's interaction history |
| **Semantic Search** | Retrieve results based on the meaning of the query using text embeddings to match the intent |
| **Visual Similarity Search** | Convert images into embeddings to retrieve visually similar items |

## 4. Popular Vector Databases and Libraries

| Database/Library | Description | Pros | Cons | Indexing |
|-----------------|-------------|------|------|-----------|
| **FAISS** | Developed by Facebook, C++ library with Python bindings | - Highly optimized<br>- Supports various indexing methods | - Requires deep indexing knowledge<br>- Not distributed by default | IVF, PQ, HNSW, Flat Index |
| **Milvus** | Open-source vector database for large-scale deployments | - Distributed<br>- Scalable<br>- Various indexing methods | - Complex setup<br>- Resource-intensive | IVF, ANNOY, HNSW |
| **Pinecone** | Managed vector database service for scaling applications | - Fully managed<br>- High availability<br>- Scalability | - Costly for large-scale use<br>- Limited control over infrastructure | HNSW, IVF |
| **Weaviate** | Open-source vector search engine with GraphQL API | - Easy to use with GraphQL API<br>- Supports hybrid search | - Performance limited for very large datasets<br>- Limited indexing options | HNSW |
| **ANNoy** | Developed by Spotify, open-source library for ANN search | - Lightweight<br>- Easy to use<br>- Suitable for read-heavy workloads | - Does not support updates to the index once built<br>- Limited scalability for very large datasets | Hierarchical K-Means Trees |
| **Elasticsearch with Vectors** | Elasticsearch has added support for vector similarity through plugins | - Combines text-based and vector-based search<br>- Familiar if already using Elasticsearch | - Less optimized for purely vector search<br>- Can be resource-intensive for high-dimensional vector data | HNSW |

## 5. How Vector Databases Work

1. **Data Ingestion**: Raw data such as text, images, or audio are fed into a pre-trained model to generate embeddings. For example, a Transformer model can convert a sentence into a dense vector that captures its semantic meaning.

2. **Indexing**: The vector embeddings are stored in a vector database, which uses specialized indexing methods to enable fast similarity searches. Common indexing methods include:

   - **IVF (Inverted File Index)**: Divides the vector space into clusters to limit the number of vectors that need to be compared.
   - **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs)**: Constructs graphs of vectors to allow efficient traversal and search.
   - **PQ (Product Quantization)**: Compresses vectors to save space and enable fast approximate searches.

3. **Querying**: A query vector is generated similarly to the database vectors, and the system then looks for the nearest neighbors to that vector using similarity metrics.

## 6. Indexing Techniques Overview

| Technique                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Exact vs. Approximate Search** | Exact Search guarantees the closest neighbors but is computationally expensive. Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search provides substantial speed gains by sacrificing some accuracy. |
| **HNSW**                         | Creates a graph where each point (vector) is connected to its nearest neighbors, allowing efficient traversal for high-dimensional data.                                           |
| **IVF**                          | Divides the vector space into cells, reducing the search space by focusing only on relevant cells during a query.                                                                  |

## 7. Example Workflows with FAISS

### Example 1: Search with FAISS

```python
import numpy as np
import faiss

# Generate some random vectors as data
d = 128  # dimension of vectors
nb = 10000  # number of database vectors
nq = 5  # number of query vectors

np.random.seed(1234)  # fix random seed for reproducibility
db_vectors = np.random.random((nb, d)).astype('float32')
query_vectors = np.random.random((nq, d)).astype('float32')

# Create the index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)  # L2 distance
index.add(db_vectors)  # add vectors to the index

# Search for the 5 nearest neighbors of each query vector
k = 5
D, I = index.search(query_vectors, k)  # D: distances, I: indices of nearest neighbors
print("Indices of nearest neighbors:", I)
print("Distances of nearest neighbors:", D)

```python

# Example 2: Recommendation System with FAISS

import numpy as np
import faiss

# Generate item and user embeddings
d = 128  # dimension of vectors
n_items = 10000  # number of item vectors
n_users = 10  # number of user vectors

np.random.seed(1234)  # fix random seed for reproducibility
item_vectors = np.random.random((n_items, d)).astype('float32')
user_vectors = np.random.random((n_users, d)).astype('float32')

# Create the index
index = faiss.IndexFlatIP(d)  # Inner product (cosine similarity)
index.add(item_vectors)  # add item vectors to the index

# Find top-k recommended items for each user
k = 5
D, I = index.search(user_vectors, k)  # D: scores, I: indices of top-k items
print("Recommended item indices for each user:", I)

image_vectors = np.random.random((n_images, d)).astype('float32')
query_vectors = np.random.random((n_queries, d)).astype('float32')

# Create the index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(d)  # L2 distance for visual similarity
index.add(image_vectors)  # add image vectors to the index

# Search for the most visually similar images
k = 5
D, I = index.search(query_vectors, k)  # D: distances, I: indices of similar images
print("Indices of similar images:", I)
print("Distances of similar images:", D)
```
