       - **Availability**: Every request receives a response (even if it is not the most up-to-date).
       - **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to function despite network failures.
     - **Effect on Design**: System designers must choose which property to prioritize based on the use case. For example, systems like NoSQL databases might sacrifice strong consistency for better availability and partition tolerance.

## 4. **How do database indexes work, and why are they important?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Indexes** are data structures that allow faster retrieval of records in a database by maintaining an additional data structure to improve query performance.
     - They work by storing a sorted version of a specific column or set of columns, allowing the database engine to quickly locate the desired rows.
     - **Importance**: Indexes significantly reduce the time complexity of read queries, making searches more efficient, especially on large datasets.

## 5. **What is replication, and what are the different replication strategies?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Replication**: The process of storing copies of data on multiple nodes to increase fault tolerance and availability.
     - **Strategies**:
       - **Single-leader replication**: One leader node processes all writes, and follower nodes replicate the leader’s data.
       - **Multi-leader replication**: Multiple nodes can accept writes, and they replicate data among themselves.
       - **Leaderless replication**: Any node can accept writes, and data consistency is managed through a quorum-based system like in Cassandra.

## 6. **What are the pros and cons of eventual consistency?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Pros**:
       - Better **availability** and performance in distributed systems.
       - **Scalable**: Systems like NoSQL databases (e.g., Cassandra) use eventual consistency to handle large, distributed datasets across many nodes.
     - **Cons**:
       - There is a window of time where different nodes might have **inconsistent data**.
       - May require **conflict resolution** when nodes are updated with conflicting data during network partitions.

## 7. **What is a data model, and what are the differences between relational and NoSQL data models?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Data Model**: Defines how data is structured and accessed.
     - **Relational Data Model**: Uses structured tables with predefined schemas (e.g., SQL databases). Supports complex queries and ACID transactions.
     - **NoSQL Data Models**: Include key-value, document, column-family, and graph models. NoSQL is more flexible in schema and better suited for horizontal scaling and unstructured data.

---

## 8. **What is sharding, and why is it used?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Sharding** is a technique used to split and distribute data across multiple databases or servers to improve scalability.
     - **Why it’s used**: Sharding allows a system to scale horizontally by distributing the load and storage across multiple nodes, ensuring that no single node becomes a bottleneck.

## 9. **How does distributed transaction processing work?**
   - **Answer**:
     - Distributed transactions involve coordinating a transaction across multiple nodes or services.
     - **Techniques**:
       - **Two-phase commit (2PC)**: A distributed algorithm that ensures all participants in a transaction either commit or roll back.
       - **Consensus protocols** like **Paxos** or **Raft**: Used for coordinating actions among distributed nodes to achieve agreement.

## 10. **What is the purpose of batch processing, and how does it differ from stream processing?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Batch Processing**: Executes tasks on a large set of data at once, typically for scheduled tasks (e.g., end-of-day reports).
     - **Stream Processing**: Processes data in real-time or near real-time as it flows through the system.
     - **Key Difference**: Batch processing deals with static datasets and is optimized for throughput, while stream processing handles dynamic, continuous data and focuses on low-latency processing.

---

## 11. **What are data warehouses and data lakes, and how are they different?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Data Warehouse**: A centralized repository designed for structured data, primarily for querying and reporting (e.g., Redshift, BigQuery).
     - **Data Lake**: A storage system for unstructured and structured data, typically in raw form (e.g., Hadoop, S3). It allows more flexibility for data exploration and analytics.
     - **Key Difference**: Data lakes can store raw data for later processing, whereas data warehouses focus on processed, structured data optimized for querying.

---

## 12. **What is event sourcing, and how is it different from traditional state-based storage?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Event Sourcing**: A design pattern where changes to the system are stored as a sequence of events rather than overwriting the current state. Each event is a fact that happened at a particular time.
     - **Traditional State-Based Storage**: Only the current state is stored, with no history of how the system arrived at that state.
     - **Difference**: Event sourcing provides a complete audit trail and allows reconstructing the state at any point in time.

---

## 13. **How do you handle data consistency in distributed systems?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Techniques**:
       - **Quorum-based consistency**: Ensure that a majority of nodes have agreed upon a value before accepting a write or read (e.g., Cassandra).
       - **Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs)**: Data structures designed for eventual consistency, allowing concurrent updates without conflict.
       - **Version vectors**: Track the history of data changes across distributed systems, allowing conflict resolution when necessary.

---

## 14. **How do you approach data durability in a distributed system?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Replication**: Ensure that data is replicated across multiple nodes to prevent loss due to node failure.
     - **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)**: Log every change before it’s applied to ensure that if the system crashes, changes can be recovered.
     - **Snapshots**: Take periodic snapshots of the data to ensure that it can be restored in case of failure.

---

## 15. **What is CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation), and why is it used?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **CQRS**: A pattern that separates the read (query) and write (command) sides of an application. Commands change the state, while queries read the current state.
     - **Why it’s used**: CQRS helps optimize performance by allowing different models for reading and writing data, improving scalability, and enabling event-driven architectures.
